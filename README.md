# suppressor

**Zero-latency, frequency-split noise suppressor for guitar DI** — built for
high-gain amp-sim and reamping chains. It sits on the raw DI *before* the amp
sim, strips pickup-borne hiss/buzz/EMI between notes, and leaves the guitar
body alone. Formats: **VST3** and **CLAP** (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## What it does

The core is a causal, sample-domain **dynamic low-pass**:

- the input is split by a fourth-order Linkwitz–Riley-style crossover;
- the **low branch always passes** (body, fundamentals, sustain);
- the **high branch** is gated by an envelope detector that listens to the
  high branch itself — bass energy can't reopen the noise branch, pick
  attack and string harmonics can;
- the gate opens in **10 µs**, holds through waveform zero-crossings, and
  closes on a smooth exponential release.

The result: noise between notes disappears in the band where hiss/buzz
lives, while low mids and body pass untouched and pick transients survive
intact. Zero reported latency in the default mode; negligible CPU (four
biquads plus an envelope per channel).

## Controls

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Threshold** | Sets when highs are reduced. Raise it until noise between notes is suppressed. |
| **Strength** | Sets how much of the high-frequency range is treated (8 kHz → 1.4 kHz). Zero is not bypass. |
| **Release** | Sets how quickly suppression returns after a note (2–30 ms). Increase it to preserve tails. |
| **Listen removed** | Auditions input minus processed audio; switch it off to hear the processed signal. This difference includes filter phase effects, not just noise. |

Input and output meters show **peak dBFS**. The large readout shows
**high-band gain reduction**, not whole-signal loudness loss; in multiband
sessions it shows the deepest band reduction. Clip warnings, bypass, silence,
learning, and stopped audio are labelled explicitly. Stopped meters clear
instead of holding stale readings.

Drag a dial to adjust; **Shift-drag** for fine control, **double-click / Return**
for exact entry, and **Alt/Option-click / Home** to reset. Tab and arrow keys
work too. Use your host's bypass to compare with the dry input.

Existing sessions and automation remain compatible. The additional engine
settings remain available in the host's parameter view, not in the simplified
editor. **Host settings active** indicates non-default legacy settings; hover
for details. In multiband mode, Threshold and Strength are inactive because
that mode uses its own splits and learned thresholds.

## Building

Requirements: CMake ≥ 3.22, a C++17 compiler, Ninja (recommended).
JUCE and the CLAP wrapper are fetched automatically (pinned versions).

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --target Suppressor_VST3 Suppressor_CLAP Suppressor_Standalone
```

Outputs land in `build/Source/Suppressor_artefacts/Release/{VST3,CLAP,Standalone}`.

### Unit tests

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-tests -G Ninja -DSUPPRESSOR_BUILD_PLUGIN=OFF -DSUPPRESSOR_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build-tests && ctest --test-dir build-tests --output-on-failure
```

### UI and wrapper tests

```bash
cmake --build build --target SuppressorUITests
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

These also exercise native VST3/CLAP editor embedding. Linux needs a display
(or `xvfb-run -a`). Set `SUPPRESSOR_UI_CAPTURE_DIR` to an absolute directory to
save real editor captures at 100–200% scaling.

### CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` gates every push/PR on:

1. **DSP unit tests** on Windows, macOS, and Linux;
2. **VST3 + CLAP builds** on all three platforms (macOS universal);
3. **validation** with pluginval (VST3) and clap-validator (CLAP);
4. per-OS artifact packaging. Tags matching `v*` publish a GitHub release.

topology, parameter laws, timing, and the rationale behind every
improvement over a plain one-split gate.

proprietary relicensing. CLAP is MIT-licensed.
